## Overview

Hi everyone! This is my first project from Frontend Mentor. As mentioned above, it's a browser extensions manager — it's responsive, supports light and dark themes, and includes filter and remove functionalities.
I tried to match the original Frontend Mentor design as closely as possible, but I'm sure I made some mistakes. Feel free to share any feedback on this project!.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Toggle extensions between active and inactive states
- Filter active and inactive extensions
- Remove extensions from the list
- Select their color theme
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- CSS BEM
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### Continued development

I want to work on the transitions and animations — maybe add some fade-in effects when the page loads, and smooth transitions when the cards disappear.
